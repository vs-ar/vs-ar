## **Prompt Engineering Techniques with Examples**

Prompt engineering involves crafting effective prompts to optimize how large language models (LLMs) generate responses. Different techniques can be used to improve accuracy, relevance, and creativity based on the task.

---

## **1. Zero-Shot Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
Zero-shot prompting asks the model to perform a task without providing any example. The model relies entirely on its pre-trained knowledge.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"Translate the following English sentence to French: 'Where is the nearest restaurant?'"*  

**Model Output:**  
*"Où est le restaurant le plus proche ?"*

### **When to Use:**  
- When the model has been trained on similar tasks.
- For general knowledge or well-known tasks.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Quick and requires no training data.  
❌ Less reliable for complex or niche tasks.

---

## **2. Few-Shot Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
Few-shot prompting provides a few examples to guide the model before requesting a response.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"Translate the following English sentences to French:  
1. 'Good morning!' → 'Bonjour !'  
2. 'How are you?' → 'Comment ça va ?'  
3. 'Where is the nearest restaurant?' →"*

**Model Output:**  
*"Où est le restaurant le plus proche ?"*

### **When to Use:**  
- When the model needs contextual hints to understand the expected output.
- When dealing with niche or complex tasks.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ More accurate than zero-shot for nuanced tasks.  
❌ Can still generate errors if examples aren’t representative.

---

## **3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
CoT prompting encourages the model to break down reasoning step-by-step, improving logical consistency.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"If a store sells 5 apples for $10, how much would 12 apples cost? Explain step by step."*

**Model Output:**  
*"First, we calculate the price per apple: $10 / 5 apples = $2 per apple.  
Next, we multiply by 12: 12 apples × $2 = $24.  
Thus, the cost of 12 apples is $24."*

### **When to Use:**  
- When the task involves logical reasoning or complex calculations.
- For tasks that require intermediate steps (math, coding, etc.).

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Helps the model generate more accurate and explainable results.  
❌ Longer responses and may still contain logical mistakes.

---

## **4. Self-Consistency Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
Instead of relying on one response, the model generates multiple responses and selects the most consistent answer.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"If a car travels at 60 mph for 3 hours, how far does it travel? Provide multiple possible solutions."*

**Model Output (Multiple Responses):**  
1. *Speed × Time = Distance → 60 × 3 = 180 miles.*  
2. *Convert mph to minutes → 60 mph = 1 mile per minute → 3 hours = 180 minutes → 180 miles.*  
3. *Divide journey into segments → 1 hour = 60 miles → 3 hours = 180 miles.*

The most consistent answer is chosen: *180 miles.*

### **When to Use:**  
- When accuracy is crucial and errors are costly.
- Tasks with multiple ways to reach a solution.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Increases reliability in complex reasoning tasks.  
❌ Requires multiple generations, increasing computation time.

**Model Output:**  
1. *The article discusses climate change impacts on agriculture.*  
2. *It highlights new farming techniques to combat droughts.*  
3. *It suggests policy changes for sustainable food production.*

### **When to Use:**  
- When precise control over the output format is needed.
- For structured responses like summaries, step-by-step guides, or reports.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Ensures the output follows a defined structure.  
❌ May still require tweaking for optimal clarity.

---

## **6. Role-Based Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
Assigning a role to the model to influence its style, tone, or knowledge domain.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"You are a financial advisor. Explain the concept of compound interest in simple terms."*

**Model Output:**  
*"Compound interest is when you earn interest on your savings, and then you also earn interest on the interest you already gained. Over time, your money grows faster!"*

### **When to Use:**  
- When a specific expertise, tone, or personality is needed.
- For use cases like customer support, storytelling, or consulting.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Improves coherence and realism in responses.

---

## **7. Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
### **What It Is:**  
Combines few-shot and CoT prompting to provide step-by-step reasoning with examples.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"Solve the following math problem step by step:  
Example 1:  
Q: If a train moves at 80 mph and travels for 2.5 hours, how far does it go?  
A: Step 1: Multiply speed by time → 80 × 2.5 = 200 miles.  
Example 2:  
Q: If a plane flies at 500 mph for 4 hours, how far does it travel?  
A: Step 1:"*

**Model Output:**  
*"Multiply speed by time → 500 × 4 = 2000 miles."*

### **When to Use:**  
- For improving logical consistency in complex reasoning tasks.
- When few-shot learning alone is not enough.

### **Pros & Cons:**  
✅ Boosts accuracy significantly for logical tasks.  
❌ Still requires well-chosen examples.

---

## **8. Deliberate Misinterpretation Avoidance**
### **What It Is:**  
Ensures the model doesn’t misinterpret ambiguous queries.

### **Example:**
**Prompt:**  
*"I want to book a flight for me and my cat. Can you confirm if airlines allow pets?"*  
Instead of answering immediately, the model asks for clarification.

**Model Output:**  
*"Are you asking about a specific airline’s pet policy, or do you need general guidelines on flying with pets?"*

### **When to Use:**  
- When ambiguity is present in user queries.
